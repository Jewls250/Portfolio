# Portfolio

I am creating my portfolio using html, css, bootstrap and javascript.

In my portfolio, about me and contact. I am created a navbar, that uses links to navigates through my portfolio, about me and contact. It also has links to my facebook, instagram, github and linkedIn. If you click a link to my social media pages it will open a new window. I also used a fixed nav bar so it is easy to look through my portfolio.
